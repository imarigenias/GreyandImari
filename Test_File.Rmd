# Background info on R
This is a [link](https://www.middleprofessor.com/files/applied-biostatistics_bookdown/_book/getting-started-r-projects-and-r-markdown.html#create-a-fake-data-chunk) to an rmarkdown created by a professor on important elements of R. It will be useful to read: 

* 2.1: R vs R Studio
* 2.5: R Markdown in a nutshell (you don't need to download R markdown) 
* 2.7: importing packages
* 2.8 Create an R Studio Project (don't actually create one, just check out how it works)
* 2.9: Working on a project, in a nutshell 
* 2.11.1  Create a “fake-data” chunk
* 2.11.3 Knit the Rmd

## R Markdown info
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Get Redcap Data into R
## Lucas Instructions {#instructions}
[Instructions](https://github.com/jlucasmckay/motionTools/blob/main/doc/02_redcap.md) from Lucas on github.

## Create environ file
On R Studio: File > New File > New Text File. Save the file as ".Renviron." Make sure it is saved in the project directory. 

## Install "motionTools" package
```{r install-packages, eval=FALSE}
  install.packages("devtools")
  devtools::install_github("jlucasmckay/motionTools")
```
You have to install the `devtools` package to obtain a function that will allow
you to download the R package (motionTools) Lucas has created for data analysis.

Make sure you have [R version 4.1.1](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/). 
Then, go to Tools > Global Options... > Code >
check "Use native pipe operator." 

### Loading packages
```{r load-libraries, }
  library(motionTools)
  library(tidyverse)
```
You download R packages once, but you have to load them every time you want to use them, using `library(package-name)`. Alternatively, you can use  `package-name::function-name()` to specify the function and library you are using in your code. 

### Info on tidyverse package {#tidyverse}
Here's a link to [cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for the `tidyverse` package that will be useful for this analysis. Pay special attention to `dplyr` and `tidyr`.

## Reading a report into R
The example on github uses information specific to a certain sample report, so it might not work for us. I'm going to use the report "Patients with Missing LEDD."

### Creating an R dataset from redcap data
```{r create-redcap-data,}
redcap_data = ReadRedcapReport(token = Sys.getenv("PDFalls_redcap_token"), url = "https://redcap.emory.edu/api/", report_id = 32116)

redcap_data

```
`redcap_data=ReadRedcapReport`creates a data frame called `redcap_data` using the `ReadRedcapReport` function from the `motionTools` package. I created it without manipulating the data set first, so I can show you what information it displays and how. 

### Manipulate data output 
```{r}
  rd_data1 = redcap_data |>  
    arrange(ledd) |> 
    select(record_id, ledd)
  
  rd_data1
```
The next lines I have added after creating the data set specify how to arrange the data and which columns I want in the output. These functions come from the `dplyr` package mentioned [earlier](#tidyverse), which is used in data manipulation. 
Also read up  on [piping](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html). (The pipe operator looks like `|>` and not `%>%` now).

# Edit data in R
There are many things we can do from here. I didn't edit any of the data sets, because I am not sure how that will affect things on Redcap. Lucas will show us what he wants us to do and how. 


I'll create a sample data set just to practice some things we might do, such as replacing missing data or changing values.
```{r}
    patients <- data.frame("ID" = c("01", "02", "03", "04", "05", "06", "07",
                                    "08","09", "10"),
                           "Age" = c(50, 18, NA, 45, NA, 20, 45, 60, 89, 90),
                           "Dosage" = c(100, 120, 130, NA, 3000, 450, 800, 300,
                                        NA, 500),
                           "Dosage_Manual" = c(100, 250, 130, 150, 300, 450, 800, 
                                               300,20,50)
                           )
    patients
```

## Select columns and rows
```{r}
  # Select specific column --> df_name$col_name
  patients$ID
  
  #Select column by number --> df[, num_col]
  patients[, 1]
  
  #Select specific row --> df[num_row, ]
  patients[1, ]
  
```

## Explore data 
### Counts
```{r}
  # Num of patients with dosage above 100 (TRUE)
  table(patients$Dosage > 100)
  
  # Number of missing values (TRUE)
  table(is.na(patients$Age))
  
```

## Descriptive Statistics
```{r}
  # Summary of each variable
  summary(patients)
  
  # Summary of certain variables
  summary(patients$Age)
```


Creating new data frames from those values 
```{r}
  # Create summary 
  missingstats <- patients |> 
    summarise(numNA = sum(is.na(Dosage)),
              max_dose = max(Dosage, na.rm = TRUE))
  
 missingstats
  
```

### Select observations based on criteria 
```{r}
  #Display IDs and ages of subjects with missing Ages
  ids_ageNA<- patients |>
    filter(is.na(Age))|>  
    select(ID, Age)

  ids_ageNA
  
  # Create list of IDs
  ids_patients <- patients |>
      filter(is.na(Age))|>
      select(ID) |> 
      unlist()
  
  ids_patients
  
```
## User created functions
```{r sample_function}
  ids_needed <- findMissing(patients, ID, Age)
  ids_needed
```
Makes a data frame of the ids with the missing value and the variable of interest we are looking at. The idea is that we would fill the missing values in an excel file and then feed it back into R. 

Extract this data frame as an excel file. 
```{r excel-output, eval=FALSE}
  install.packages("xlsx")
  library("Xlsx")

  write.xlsx(ids_needed, "missing_Age_IDS.xlsx",
           sheetName="ageNA", row.names = FALSE,
           col.names = TRUE, append=FALSE)
```
Let's say we updated the table (most likely in excel). Import the excel sheet back into R and want to update the missing values with the info we found.

Create updated data frame. 
```{r}
  # sample new data set with added info 
  replaced_ages <- ids_needed
  replaced_ages$Age <- c(20, 30)
  replaced_ages
```

Now we want to replace the missing values. In this case, I am inputting the original data frame and the updated one, and saving it to a new data frame. 
```{r}
  updated_patients <- populateMissing(patients, replaced_ages, ID, Age)
  
  updated_patients # new data set
  
  patients # old data set
```


## Add variable 
```{r}
  patients <- patients |> 
      mutate(new_dose = Dosage / 100)

  patients
```
You can make multiple new variables at once. 

## Different values 
Create data frame of observations with different variable values
```{r}
    diffDosage <- findDiff(patients, ID, Dosage, Dosage_Manual)
    diffDosage
  
```

## Arsenal 
He also mentioned an R package named `arsenal`. I'm going to download it here. I am not sure what it does.
```{r arsenal,}
    # install.packages("arsenal")
    library("arsenal")
```


Compare data frames with `comparedf` from `arsenal`.
```{r explore-arsenal,}
   comparedf(patients, updated_patients) 


  summary(comparedf(patients, updated_patients, by="ID"))

```
`comparedf()` is based on `PROC COMPARE` in SAS. The top output is the generic output. We can get more details by using the second code.
